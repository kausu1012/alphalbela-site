# Rural Roots Web Project

## Overview
The Rural Roots Web Project is designed to help individuals reconnect with their rural heritage and maintain ties with local farmers. The website features four main pages that focus on crops, rural-to-urban migration, and ways to connect with rural communities. Through engaging content and imagery, the project aims to educate visitors about the importance of agriculture and the challenges faced by those migrating to urban areas.
